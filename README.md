# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-Power-BI-Dashboard
In this project, we plan to construct a Power BI report and dashboard for Dominoâ€™s Pizza using simulated data on their Nigerian branches, sales data for two weeks, daily target figures, and product target figures for the specified period.

This project aims to analyze sales data by branch, product, and target in order to gain insights into the performance of different branches, products, and sales targets.

By analyzing this data, the company can identify areas of strength and weakness, and make data-driven decisions to improve sales and increase revenue. Additionally, by breaking down the data by branch and product, the company can identify which branches and products are most profitable, and allocate resources accordingly.

The project involved creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze sales data by branch, product, and target. The following steps were taken to create the dashboard:
1. Data acquisition: The first step was to gather the necessary data from various sources such as sales records, customer information, and product data.
2. Data cleaning: The data was then cleaned and prepared for analysis. This included removing any duplicate or irrelevant data, and ensuring that the data was in the correct format.
3. Data modeling: The cleaned data was then loaded into Power BI and modeled in a way that allowed for easy analysis and visualization.
4. Dashboard design: The next step was to design the dashboard, which included creating visualizations such as charts, tables, and maps to display the data in a clear and meaningful way.
5. Data analysis: The dashboard was used to analyze the data and uncover insights into the performance of different branches, products, and sales targets.
